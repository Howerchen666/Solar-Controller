# Solar-Controller

This is a solar controller which runs on a Raspberry Pi. The ultimate goal of this python script is to switch between your solar power and your city power seemlessly when the battery is dead. 

To configure the ports, simply set values in the port config section of the code. Optional component also have an enabled variable allowing you to disable the feature. 

More details to come!

# I have also created a website which teaches you how to install solar power for your home and how to make the hardware side of this solar controller. Check out my site at https://solar.howerchen.cn
